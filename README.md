# “The Next Life” Album Art

This is a collection of scripts for creating the album art for “The Next Life”
using [PGFPlots](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org).

To install TeX Live (which includes PGFPlots) and ImageMagick using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS, run:

```sh
brew install imagemagick texlive
```

You should then be able to create the album art by running:

```sh
./create
```
